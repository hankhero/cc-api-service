We need fresh addresses for each test run, thus we require an unique (pseud-random) seed to be passed to the test script.
Any string can be passed as seed:

   $ node test.js ABCDefgh show

The script will output an initial address and the current funding state:

    $ node test.js ABCDefgh show
    n2J6AcQZkF9Facmfte6JTqCmibJ7unfepK
    { coins: [] }
    please send some testnet bitcoins to address above

You need to send testnet coins (e.g. from a faucet http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/ ) to the address above. Check the funding state by running script again.

After coins are received, you can run the test:

    $ node test.js ABCDefgh issue

The run will generate 4 addresses, issue new coins and transfer them using API.


Parameters:

  --url= Full url to server endpoint, end with /, defaults to http://localhost:4444/api/
  
  Use like this:
  
      node test.js ABCdef show --url=http://myserver:4444/api/

  --seed= optional way to specify the seed
  
  --command = optional way to specify the command ('show' or 'issue')
